Patterns:
=========
More purchases on Sat-Sun every other week
Purchase rates reflect country timezones (+ lunch hour 8m-10pm purchases)
Purchase type ratios vary by country (e.g. US purchases more electronics)
Some ecommerce sites have more or less sales than others
Some payment types are used more than others (e.g. "card" is used more often)

Errors:  (3% error rate)
Some data will be NULL/empty
Some columns will be truncated (missing columns)
Negative product prices
